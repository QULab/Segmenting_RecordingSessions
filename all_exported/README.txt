"all_exported" folder

Original .wav files from the mono-speaker recording sessions. In the case of NSC data, these were exported from Cubase 4, the software used to record the speech.

There is a speech file for each microphone and speaker. Some speakers were recorded with only one microphone - this is taken into account in segmenting.mat.

The files are named with the speaker's pseudonym and microphone. Examples: 'aden_headset.wav', 'debrecen_standmic', 'santodomingo_tablemic.wav', 'tallinn_talkback'.
